## YOLO Projects
My friend Hasnain sb guided me to use YOLO models
I have used YOLO models for object detection, segmentation and tracking for basketball match, persons walking on the road, car number plates detections
Finally, with his continuous support, I have designed one project for inspection of cars. It can detect license plate, car parts, damaged parts, dents and scratches
